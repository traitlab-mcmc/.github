TraitLab is a Matlab toolbox for simulating, fitting and analysing tree-like binary data under a stochastic Dollo model of evolution.
It was developed as a tool to reconstruct language phylogenies using lexical trait data, but can be applied to other types of data as well.
See the [website](https://sites.google.com/site/traitlab/home) for more details of its functionality and details of publications.
A [manual](https://github.com/traitlab-mcmc/TraitLab/blob/master/TRAITLAB_MANUAL.pdf) with a worked example is included with the code.

TraitLab was developed by Luke Kelly (Cork), Geoff Nicholls (Oxford), Robin Ryder (Paris-Dauphine) and David Welch (Auckland).
Contributions and feedback are welcome.
